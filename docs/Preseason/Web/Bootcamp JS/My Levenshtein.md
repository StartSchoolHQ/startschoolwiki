# My Levenshtein

Welcome to the Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number between two strings. 

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Function**: my_levenshtein must accept two parameters (strings) and return integer.
- **Input validation**: Verify that both strings have the same length

## 📝 Task Requirements

**Calulate Qwasar version of a Levenshtein number** : Iterate through each string and determine whether there is a difference between the corresponding characters. Each time a difference is found, it counts as 1.

## ⚠️ Error Handling

- If provided strings are not the same size, -1 should be returned.
- If two empty strings are provided, 0 should be returned since there is no difference.
